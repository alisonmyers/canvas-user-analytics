# Canvas User Analytics

This project contains a number of scripts for generating data intended to visualize students progress in a Canvas course. It also allows users to summarize "Canvas Analytics" (previously known as New Analytics) at the course level. 

The script component gathers, cleans and exports data from the [Canvas LMS REST API](https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/index.html). This data can then be imported into Tableau and explored using a collection of interactive dashboards.

The project is a hybrid of Canvas Module Progress and Course Details projects. It was designed assuming the user is familiar with either of these projects, to be run for a single course at a time. The scripts also assume that the user is connecting to a specific Tableau workbook. If you are unfamiliar with either of the projects above, I recommend reviewing them individually.

## Installation (Once)

### 1. VS Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/download 

Open VS Code, and open a new terminal:

![alt text](img/vscode-new-terminal.png)

in the following steps you'll use the terminal in VSCode

### 2. Homebrew: https://brew.sh/
### 3. Follow homebrew instructions to install `Git`: https://git-scm.com/downloads/mac

### 4. Download a copy of this project either via Zip or clone

You can now open the project folder in VSCode! (Open folder)

*Alternate: you can clone the github repo to keep the project in sync. This requires a github account and a few additional setup steps.*

## Environment Setup
In terminal - enter the following commands:

1. Create a new Virtual Environment

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
```

2. Activate the environment
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```
You'll see in brackets that the terminal is now using the environment

3. Install the requirements.txt (downloads packages needed to run the scripts)

a) 
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
```

b)
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## .env Setup
> You'll typically do this once, but you may need to update the COURSE_ID in the file once saved if using for multiple courses.

- Create a file called `.env` in the `canvas-user-analytics` folder with the following fields:

  ```
  API_TOKEN =  # paste your personal token here
  COURSE_ID = # course id here i.e 12345
  API_URL = 'https://canvas.ubc.ca'
  ```
⚠️ Your token should be kept private and secure. We recommend setting expiry on your tokens, and deleting from Canvas once no longer needed.

## Updating Data / Running the Script - You'll do this every time.

### Downloading New Analytics

The project relies on a regular download of Canvas's Analytics data. You should be downloading the data from canvas - the scripts will prompt you to add the data to the correct folder when needed.

1. Navigate to Canvas Analytics -> `Reports`
2. Select `Run Report` for Course Activity

3. Save this activity file in `data/{COURSE_ID}/user_input/new_analytics_input/`

4. In VS Code: Open the project folder canvas-user-analytics
  - Check that terminal is mirroring the folder name `canvas-user-analytics`

5. Activate the environment (if it is not active already)

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

![alt text](README/image.png)

6. Run the script
```bash
python3 -m run
```

- Watch the messages in the terminal and look for any action steps (blue/white)
  
- You will see 2 input steps you must confirm: that Canvas Analytics data has been added, and that Gradebook data has been added
- Review the printed output and ensure necessary courses have completed successfully. If a course fails, error messages will provide info about what went wrong.


## Project Structure

`/src`: Python files with all the logic for gathering data from Canvas and outputting data.

`/data/COURSE_ID`: Holds the data outputted by the script. Output data will be organized into folders titled after the Canvas course id. Tables will be located in this directory in CSV files.

`/data/COURSE_ID/module_progress-Tableau`: contains **status.csv** and **module_data.csv** which detail run status and course data respectively. These three CSV's get imported into Tableau.

`/data/COURSE_ID/project_data`: This data is generated by the script 

`/data/COURSE_ID/user_input/new_analytics_input`: store your Course Analytics download here - you should add a new file when you want to update the data

`/data/COURSE_ID/user_input/gradebook_input`: this only needs to be added once (unless your course has users that add/drop regularly). This should be the Canvas gradebook download

`.env`: _Created manually_. Where user sets their Canvas API Token.

`requirements.txt`: environment file
